# IU_ComputerNetworks
This repository contains implementations and simulations of various network protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP, DNS and also Netster, a custom networking application.

## Summary
* The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the basis of web-based data communication, is used for transmitting and receiving HTTP requests and replies, and comprises server and client components.
* The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which is used to transmit emails over the Internet, illustrates how the email transmission process and SMTP client-server communication occur.
* The DNS (Domain Name System), also known as the phonebook of the Internet, converts human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
* Netster is a specially created networking application meant to show off socket programming and TCP/UDP stuff, with implementations in both C and Py. The basic network services implemented here can serve as a basis for more network experiments.

## Tools / Technologies
* C
* Python
